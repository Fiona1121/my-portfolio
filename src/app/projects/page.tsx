              In 2022, as leaders of the NTUEE Lightdance team, we developed a web-based editor system for Tron Dance. 
              This system, built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, offers a comprehensive interface for choreography design, lights simulation, and music control. 
              Throughout the project, we followed GitHub flow and conducted weekly standup meetings to ensure efficient collaboration within the team. 
              Our toolkit included technologies such as React, Redux, TypeScript, RESTful API, GraphQL, Three.js, Node.js, and MongoDB."
